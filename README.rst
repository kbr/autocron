Background task manager
=======================

Python background task manager with no dependencies beside the standard library.

(autocron is the successor of autotask. autotask is running since years in production without any problems. But it is just for django and coupled to the django-ORM. Also there is another (unrelated) project named "autotask" in the wild. Therfore the name-change.)

**This project is in alpha-state**

Please don't use it right now.
